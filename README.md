# 💧 Smart Water Data Visualization Dashboard

An interactive **React-based web application** that visualizes and analyzes water usage, leakage, and quality metrics collected from IoT-based hardware sensors.  
The system transforms raw data into clear, actionable visuals and includes predictive analytics for water usage forecasting.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **📊 Water Usage Analytics:** Visualize daily, weekly, and monthly consumption patterns through responsive charts.  
- **💦 Leakage Detection Insights:** Detect anomalies in flow and pressure readings to identify potential leaks.  
- **🔮 Usage Prediction:** Display predicted future water consumption based on historical data trends.  
- **🧪 Quality Monitoring:** Show sensor readings like pH, turbidity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen.  
- **🖥️ Interactive Dashboard:** Responsive UI built with React and charting libraries for real-time analysis.

## 🧩 Data Flow

1. **IoT Sensors** capture metrics like flow rate, water level, pH, turbidity, temperature, and leakage indicators.  
2. **Data Feed** (CSV or REST API) provides structured readings to the React app.  
3. **Frontend Dashboard** visualizes real-time and historical trends with charts and gauges.  
4. **Prediction Component** displays forecasted water usage using precomputed ML results or integrated API.

## 📊 Dashboard Sections

- **Water Usage:** Consumption trends, peak hours, and efficiency metrics  
- **Leakage Detection:** Highlighted anomaly visualization  
- **Water Quality:** pH, turbidity, temperature monitoring graphs  
- **Predictions:** Graphs comparing actual vs predicted usage
